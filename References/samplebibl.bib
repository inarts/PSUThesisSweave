When run through R or Splus, all data analysis output (tables, graphs, ...) is created on the fly and inserted into a final LATEX document. Options control which parts of the original S code are shown to or hidden from the reader, respectively. Many S users are also LATEX users, hence no new software has to be learned. The report can be automatically updated if data or analysis change, which allows for truly reproducible research. (author's abstract)}
